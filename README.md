# TrojanApp
A simple HTML5 game created using the Phaser framework, and integrated with an Android application for use as a experiment in white-hat hacking.

The game is made up of a series of stages, and is to be played while malware enters the phone and steals the contact information contained on that phone.

The purpose of this experiement is to demonstrate the risks of downloading side-loaded apps, while also showing the capabilities of the Phaser framework and our own programing skills.
