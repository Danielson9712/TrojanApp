# TrojanApp
New Project for Sophomore Project

Trying to implement scenes -> Right now only the field scene displays things, so that will be an issue for another day. The file structure still works, we'll just need to make sure they all display at some point. -> Not the purpose of this sprint though......

# Reminders
- If a sprite isn't implementing, chances are you need to add it to the config file
- Basic file set up:
    - preload()
    - create()
        - background declerations
        - character declerations
        - Functions
        - Colliders
        - Extra
    - update()
- Colliders can only be between two objects
